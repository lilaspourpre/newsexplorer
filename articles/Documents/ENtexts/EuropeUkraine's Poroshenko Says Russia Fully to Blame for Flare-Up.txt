KIEV â€”  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Friday said Russia was to blame for the latest flare-up in hostilities near the industrial town of Avdiyivka in eastern Ukraine which have led to the heaviest casualties for months.
"The full responsibility for the current sharp escalation of the situation around the Avdiyivka industrial zone ... lies with Russia and the fighters that it supports," he said in a statement.
