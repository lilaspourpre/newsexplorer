STOCKHOLM â€”  The Swedish security service says two more people have been arrested as suspects in recent attacks in southern Sweden targeting newly arrived migrants and a left-wing group.
The SAPO agency says one is suspected in a case where a device "that could have caused severe damage" was found Jan. 25 near a campsite accommodating migrants.  The bomb didn't go off.
SAPO said Thursday the other was suspected of attempted murder when a bomb went off Jan. 5, seriously injuring a person outside a nearby asylum center. The person also is suspected in a November 2016 blast outside a left-wing group's offices in Sweden's second largest city, Goteborg, and in the campsite incident.
A person arrested earlier was also suspected of involvement in last two cases. No more details were available.
