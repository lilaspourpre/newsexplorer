LYON, France —  Some key promises among 144 released Saturday by leading far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen:

On immigration:
—  Reduce immigration to 10,000 annually
—  End automatic acquisition of French nationality by marriage
—  End dual nationality for non-Europeans
— Restrict French nationality to those with French parent or naturalized, ending automatic birthright rule
— Restrict asylum to demands made in embassies or neighboring countries of asylum-seeker
On terrorism:
