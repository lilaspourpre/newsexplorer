WASHINGTON â€”  President Donald Trump vowed to overturn a Seattle judge's blocking of his executive order to keep refugees and travellers from seven countries out of the United States on Saturday.
"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned," Trump said on Twitter.
