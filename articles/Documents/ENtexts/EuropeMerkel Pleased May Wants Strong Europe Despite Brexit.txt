VALLETTA â€”  German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday welcomed remarks by Prime Minister Theresa May that Britain wanted to see a strong Europe even as it prepares to negotiate its exit from the European Union.
"I am pleased that Theresa May says that she wants a strong Europe," Merkel said at a news conference in the Maltese capital. "It's up to us, as the 27, to determine how strong, and how good and how rigorous Europe is and how we solve our problems and Germany wants to do it part on that."
