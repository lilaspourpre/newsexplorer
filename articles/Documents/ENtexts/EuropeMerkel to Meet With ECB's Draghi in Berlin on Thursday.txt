BERLIN â€”  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday to review eurozone issues, a German government spokeswoman said on Friday.
The meeting comes after Merkel rejected comments by a key aide to U.S. President Donald Trump who accused Germany of using a "grossly undervalued" euro to gain advantage over the United States and its own European Union partners.
