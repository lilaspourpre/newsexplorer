BERLIN â€”  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has accepted an invitation to attend the Feb. 17-19 Munich Security Conference, conference organizers said on Friday.
The conference in southern Germany will take place against a backdrop of uncertainty about transatlantic relations after U.S. President Donald Trump said he viewed NATO as obsolete and criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel's policies.
