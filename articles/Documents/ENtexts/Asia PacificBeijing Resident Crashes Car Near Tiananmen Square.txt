BEIJING â€”  A car crashed and overturned near Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing on Friday which police blamed on the driver losing control on a slippery road, cautioning against the spreading of rumors.
Police said on their official microblog on Friday that the 26-year-old driver had taken responsibility for the accident.
In 2013, a vehicle crashed on the edge of Tiananmen Square, killing five people and injuring dozens in what China said was a planned attack by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a Muslim Uighur separatist group.
Police said the driver, surnamed Zhang, in Friday's accident was a Beijing resident.
Tiananmen Square is at the political and cultural heart of Beijing and security is always tight in the wake of the government's bloody crackdown on student-led protests there in 1989.
