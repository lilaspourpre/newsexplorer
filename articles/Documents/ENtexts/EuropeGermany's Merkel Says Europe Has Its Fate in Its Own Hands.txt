VALLETTA â€”  German Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed for European unity ahead of a meeting of European Union leaders in Malta to discuss ways to stem the flow of migrants coming to Italy from Africa.
"Europe has its fate in its own hands," Merkel said. "The more we are clear about how we define our role in the world, the better we can also take care of our transatlantic relations."
